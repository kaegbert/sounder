A collaborative web based instrument using socket.io and node.js

Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for node.js.

Express.js is a Node.js framework. It's the most popular framework as of now (the most starred on NPM).


### The first thing you need to do is install node.js and node package manager.

[install node.js.](https://nodejs.org/en/)
We will also need to install npm (node package manager)

[This is an excellent guide for installing node if you use Mac.](https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/installing-node-js-on-osx-10-10-yosemite/)


```npm install express```

```npm install socket.io```
