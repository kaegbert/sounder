A collaborative web based instrument using socket.io and node.js

Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for node.js.

Express.js is a Node.js framework. It's the most popular framework as of now (the most starred on NPM).


The first thing you need to do is install node.js and node package manager.
[install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[This is an excellent guide for installing node if you use mac](https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/installing-node-js-on-osx-10-10-yosemite/)



```npm install socket.io```
```npm install express```
